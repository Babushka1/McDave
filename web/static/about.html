    About
  </h1>
  <p1>
    This Repository was created by McDave, a high school student at the time this is being written. He was able to do so due to the extensive and effective teachings of his tutor, a learned man who lived and continues to live his life admiring the web and the many things that you can do with it. At the moment there is nothing of significance or interest to be found in this repo, save for if you enjoy viewing webpages containing only rudimentary html.

    As there is nothing on this page besides an index, a few mundane details about the creator will be written instead. McDave celebrated his birthday recently. Blue in its many shades and tones is the favourite color of McD. This repo owner enjoys music in all forms, excluding only country and a-tonal garbage. McD is very tired currently.
